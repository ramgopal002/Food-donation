Food Donation

I have built an API named “Food Donation”. The purpose of this app is to make food donation process easier, faster and convenient.

I have implemented below functionalities in this Api.

• Volunteer can login/signup to this app.

• Donor organizations can make a food donation post (contact information, approximate people based on food quantity, etc.).

• Volunteer accept food request post.

• Volunteer can view the lists of available food donorsQ.
